### About This Research

This repository contains the revolutionary white paper on **Fractal Harmonic Recursion** and the **Fractal Harmonic Code Framework**. The research demonstrates that triadic switching logic represents the fundamental self-generating recursive process that creates reality's information processing structure.

### Key Concepts

- **Fractal Harmonics** - Self-similar patterns across all scales of existence
- **Triadic Switching Logic** - Three-phase comfort/activation/comfort cycles (f₁:f₂:f₃ = n₁:n₂:n₃)
- **Recursive Self-Generation** - Pattern that creates itself through its own operation
- **Universal Computational Architecture** - Reality as a self-bootstrapping computational system
- **Harmonic Energy** - Information and data becoming energy through recursive fractal weighting

### Research Areas

- Quantum mechanics and fractal recursion
- Unified field theory candidate
- Computational universe theory
- Bootstrap paradox resolution
- Observer-observed unity
- Consciousness as recursive self-awareness
- Engineering optimization through harmonic timing
- Predictive modeling across domains

### Applications

- CPU processing optimization (50% energy reduction potential)
- Mechanical systems efficiency
- Propulsion systems
- Behavioral prediction systems
- Economic cycle analysis
- Climate pattern modeling
